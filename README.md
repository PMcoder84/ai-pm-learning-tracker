📘 **AI PM Technical Trade-Offs — Master Learning Tracker**

A complete guide to mastering non-deterministic system trade-offs for AI Product Managers.


**This repository contains:**

📊 AI_PM_Tradeoffs_Tracker (Excel) to track your learning

🧠 Full list of trade-offs every AI PM must master

🔍 Categorized across Traditional ML, GenAI, and Classical AI

🎓 Designed for interview prep, portfolio building, and real-world product decision-making


🧭 **Why This Matters**

AI PMs must navigate uncertainty, probabilistic behaviors, and system trade-offs across ML, GenAI, and agent ecosystems.

The best AI PMs can answer questions like:

“Should we use a larger model, accept higher latency, or redesign the UX flow?”

This repo gives you the full map.
